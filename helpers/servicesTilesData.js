        description: "Birth support is probably what comes to mind for most people when they think about the service a doula provides. Birth support includes helping you navigate decision-making and plans throughout your pregnancy, supporting you emotionally and with comfort measures during labor and delivery, and checking in on you after birth. Birth support can be virtual or in-person and includes two formal prenatal appointments (and additional phone or text support throughout your pregnancy, as needed), labor and birth support, and one postpartum appointment. Choosing the right birth doula for you and your family is a lot like choosing your friends and partners - you will likely want your doula to be a good “fit” for you and your birth preferences, someone you can “vibe with” in your interactions. For that reason, I always offer a free virtual consultation so we can get to know each other better before committing to service."

        description: "Doula support doesn’t have to end once a baby is born! In fact, for some individuals and families postpartum support is even more critical and beneficial than labor and birth support. Many cultures observe a 30 or 40 day period after birth where family and community focus on nourishing and caring for the new parent so that they can rest, recover, and transition to the next phase of life in as supported a manner as possible."

        description: "Different from the type of sibling support provided in the postpartum period, this service offering is for those who may need help with childcare of other children during labor and delivery. This can be helpful for those planning to birth at home or outside of the home! Birthing families without relatives or close friends nearby may find this type of support very comforting since labor can begin and progress quickly before others can travel to support you."

Some of the additional services I offer include: Pregnancy and Infant Loss support, NICU support, Abortion support, Preconception support, and Birth planning support. If you’re navigating a major life transition or experience and are looking for support, chances are I can assist you in some way. Reach out to me if you’re seeking help with something not listed above and we can discuss how I may be able to assist you.",
